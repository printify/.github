### Printify is a transparent print-on-demand and dropshipping platform, designed to help online entrepreneurs make more money in a simple and easy way. 

Recently we announced our secured ‚≠ê $45M in Series A funding ‚≠ê led by Index Ventures, with participation from H&M Group, Virgin Group, founders of leading technology companies Wise, Vinted, Squarespace, RedHat, and entertainment industry investors such as Will Smith‚Äôs Dreamers VC. 
 
We are headquartered in Latvia üá±üáª with close to 500 team members. Printify values talent over location, so most of our positions are remote-friendly. It means that not only daily work but also internal events such as hackathons are accessible for all engineers working at Printify.
